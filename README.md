# Repository-Collection
When you access a GitHub repository, it displays all the projects within that repository, along with the profile photo of the repository owner. This provides a quick overview of the repository's contents and its author.

# Features
- Fetch the user's GitHub profile name
- List all public repositories of the specified GitHub user along with the profile name
- Handle errors gracefully, including cases where the username is invalid or repositories cannot be fetched.
